# Asteroids üõ∏‚òÑÔ∏è

I have developed a replica of the asteroids video game in python, using the pygame library for my second boot.dev project.

You can use the uv package manager and the uv.lock file to reproduce the environment I used to develop the game, so you can play it.

Once you'vre re-created the environment, just run the command below to run the game:
```
uv run main.py
```

You can also use cmd + q on Mac (or equilavent command on another OS) to quit the game.

## New Features üëÄ
The game is fully playable, however I would like to get around to adding features from the list of improvements below to enhance the user experience of the game:
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
